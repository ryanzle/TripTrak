                Our experienced tutors will meet with you one-on-one to teach the basics of After Effects. 
                After you create an account, you can customize your profile with your current experience and the skills 
                you want to learn. Then, you can either let a tutor contact you first, or you can browse our list of tutors 
                and reach out to one on your own.

            <p class = "tab">
                Click on the button in the header on the top of the screen that says "Register." There, you will be 
                linked to the register page, where you can input your email, username, and password. Your email is private 
                and will not be shown to your tutor unless you choose to share it; you will be identified to your tutor by 
                your username. After creating an account, you will be able to access your tutor portal.
            </p>
            <li id = "q3" class = "q">What is the tutor portal?</li>
            <p class = "tab">
                The tutor portal is empty until you are matched with a tutor. When you are assigned a tutor, your tutor's 
                information, including their name, username, After Effects experience, and more. This is also where you can 
                find the link to your individual meeting.
            </p>
            <li id = "q4" class = "q">How do I meet with my tutor?</li>
            <p class = "tab">
                All meetings are individual and done online through your tutor's chosen platform. You can find your tutor's 
                meeting link through your tutor portal.
